# gitâ€”Madivad's Cheatsheet
*I'm new to git and github and I found that most online tutorials were either too basic or too complicated. I don't want to be just told how to do something, I want to understand WHY it is that I am doing something this way. So this is what I have learned after 2 days of youtube, stackexchange and general experimentation. I hope this help you, Cheers.*

## I see there are THESE starting points:
1. You have your own local repository (repo) and *local remote* \* repo. This is a great starting point for experimentation.
1. You have your own repo (repository) on github and you want to continue doing some development on your local machine
1. You have a project on your local machine and you want to put it up on github and manage it from there
1. You have downloaded a repository (repo) from github and you've experimented with it. You now want to make some changes

\* *a "local remote" is a remote repo that is local to you on your computer or your own network. I used a local remote to do a lot of testing on this and to really get a grasp of what was actually going on.*

# 1. Scenario: All local
We're going to write a quick bash script that (for whatever reason) you want to manage through a local git repo. We're going to look at this as if we've already started work on the file and we're now going to add it.

\* *The current working directory should only contain files pertinent to your project. If it contains any other projects or files, you'll need to create a specific directory for it. Not necessary, but I now have a `git` folder with each of the projects listed under it.*

this is our file:

    ~/git/my-awesome-script/hello-world.sh

----

## Don't mind them, just show me what I need (tl;dr)
### For the quick and dirty, let's just download something from github and make changes. We will then upload that back to our own github account

## Start a local repo and want to push it up online to git
## Fork a repo from someone else's git
## Bring your own repo to local (and make changes and upload)
*an example of this is you have a repo online from a previous install or from another computer. You want to start working on it again*
* first, clone it to local  
`git clone {repo-details}`  
eg:  
`git clone https://github.com/madivad/project.git`

* change into the directory (`cd {project}`)
* make your edit or add your file

If you added a file, `add` it to the repo:  
`git add {filename}`

Commit your new/edited file to the local repo:  

    git commit {filename} -m "{commit message}"
    git push
    git rebase master {branch}  #<< Yeah, I didn't checkin





    git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph

# Create a new repo from the command line
* *from what I've been able to work out, you can't COMPLETELY create a repo from the command line, you must at least START the process on github itself.*
* *start in the working directory of your project*
* *this can be an existing unmanaged project or a new project*

### on your github page:
1. click the plus sign in the top left corner and select `new repository`.
1. give the repository a name (required), a description (optional), select between public or private (private is a paid feature), and **DO NOT** `initialize this repository with a README`. Also, do not add a `.gitignore` or license from this screen.
1. click `Create repository`

### back in your working directory:

1. If you don't have a `README.md`, create one:

    echo "# {ProjectName}" > README.md

2. then:


    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git
    git push -u origin master

3. If you already have a managed project in your project folder (you probably won't be reading these instructions), then:


    git remote add origin https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git
    git push -u origin master

---

# `remote` repos and `origin` what are they?
This one wasn't immediately obvious to me.

When you add a remote `origin` you are adding an alias to make the whole process of management that little bit easier.

### First add origin to the repo
What we are really doing is creating a local alias for a remote repo.

    git remote add origin https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git

You can verify the remote alias by typing: `git remote -v`

    $git remote -v
    origin	git@github.com:madivad/cheatsheet.git (fetch)
    origin	git@github.com:madivad/cheatsheet.git (push)


`origin` is a local alias for a remote repository. Now instead of pushing to your remote repo via a URL, you can simply `push origin master`:

Before:

    git push https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git master

After:

    git push origin master

Just remember, origin (in this instance) is located on github by virtue of the `remote add`.

Next, let's make authentication wasier.

# Add SSH key to github
As long as your PC is secure, adding an SSH key to github makes authentication much easier.

* Go to your avatar in the top left corner,
* Click on settings,  
* Go down to SSH and GPG keys.
* Add your PUBLIC key here.

Now when pushing commits to github you will no longer be asked for your credentials.

# Other little tidbits
### Git commands to remote github can be either by `HTTPS` or `SSH`:

    git clone git@github.com{user}/{project}.git
    git clone https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git

## `git pull` = `git fetch` and `git merge`
### first: git clone
`git clone` will clone a repo from github into a directory named after the online project. ie:

    git clone https://github.com/madivad/cheatsheet.git

will create a directory called: `cheatsheet`

    $ls -al cheatsheet/
    total 20
    drwxr-xr-x 3 madivad madivad 4096 Aug  1 13:34 .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 madivad madivad 4096 Aug  1 13:34 ..
    drwxr-xr-x 8 madivad madivad 4096 Aug  1 13:34 .git
    -rw-r--r-- 1 madivad madivad 4113 Aug  1 13:34 README.md

What it also does is sets up a remote origin to that project. This comes in handy later.

    $ cat cheatsheet/.git/config
    [core]
      repositoryformatversion = 0
      filemode = true
      bare = false
      logallrefupdates = true
    [remote "origin"]
      url = https://github.com/madivad/cheatsheet
      fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
      [branch "master"]
      remote = origin
      merge = refs/heads/working
