# gitâ€”Madivad's Cheatsheet
*I'm new to git and github and I found that most online tutorials were either too basic or too complicated. I don't want to be just told how to do something, I want to understand WHY it is that I am doing something this way. So this is what I have learned after 2 days of youtube, stackexchange and general experimentation. I hope this help you, Cheers.*

## I see there are THESE starting points:
1. You have your own local repository (repo) and *local remote* \* repo. This is a great starting point for experimentation.
1. You have your own repo (repository) on github and you want to continue doing some development on your local machine
1. You have a project on your local machine and you want to put it up on github and manage it from there
1. You have downloaded a repository (repo) from github and you've experimented with it. You now want to make some changes

\* *a "local remote" is a remote repo that is local to you on your computer or your own network. I used a local remote to do a lot of testing on this and to really get a grasp of what was actually going on.*

# 1. Scenario: All local
We're going to write a quick bash script that (for whatever reason) you want to manage through a local git repo. We're going to look at this as if we've already started work on the file and we're now going to add it.

\* *The current working directory should only contain files pertinent to your project. If it contains any other projects or files, you'll need to create a specific directory for it. Not necessary, but I now have a `git` folder with each of the projects listed under it.*

this is our file:

    ~/git/my-awesome-script/hello-world.sh



## Don't mind them, just show me what I need (tl;dr)
### For the quick and dirty, let's just download something from github and make changes. We will then upload that back to our own github account

## Start a local repo and want to push it up online to git
## Fork a repo from someone else's git
## Bring your own repo to local (and make changes and upload)
*an example of this is you have a repo online from a previous install or from another computer. You want to start working on it again*
* first, clone it to local  
`git clone {repo-details}`  
eg:  
`git clone https://github.com/madivad/project.git`

* change into the directory (`cd {project}`)
* make your edit or add your file

If you added a file, `add` it to the repo:  
`git add {filename}`

Commit your new/edited file to the local repo:  

    git commit {filename} -m "{commit message}"
    git push
    git rebase master {branch}  #<< Yeah, I didn't checkin





    git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph

# Create a new repo from the command line
* *start in the working directory of your project*
* *this can be an existing unmanaged project or a new project*

If you don't have a `README.md`, quickly create one:

    echo "# {ProjectName}" > README.md

then:

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin git@github.com{user}/{project}.git
    git remote add origin https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git
    git push -u origin master

If you already have a managed project in your project folder (you probably won't be reading these instructions), then:

    git remote add origin https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git


Git commands to remote github can be either by `HTTPS` or `SSH`:


git remote add origin git@github.com{user}/{project}.git
git clone git@github.com{user}/{project}.git

git remote add origin https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git

# Add SSH key to github
As long as your PC is secure, adding an SSH key to github makes authentication much easier.

Go to your avatar in the top left corner. Click on settings and go down to SSH and GPG keys. Add your PUBLIC key here.


# `remote` repos and `origin` what are they?
This one wasn't immediately obvious to me.

`origin` is a local alias for a remote repository. When you push to `origin`
Now instead of:

    git push https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git master

or

    git push origin master

where origin is located on github
